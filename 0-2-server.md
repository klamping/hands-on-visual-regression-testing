# Get the sample website

To help illustrate the tools on a real-world site, these exercises use [a customized version](https://github.com/klamping/Responsive-Starter-Kit) of [Michael Gilbert’s Responsive Starter Kit](https://github.com/mpgilbertusa/Responsive-Starter-Kit). 

The two codebases are almost identical, except the one used in these tutorials has a small Node.js server script to help with testing some unique use cases.

## Installing the codebase

To install the codebase, either clone the git repository by running `git clone https://github.com/klamping/Responsive-Starter-Kit.git` from the directory you want to install at, or [download the source](https://github.com/klamping/Responsive-Starter-Kit/archive/master.zip) and extract it to the directory of your choice.

## Install the dependencies

There a few dependencies the node server needs to run. Install them by running `npm install`.

## Run the server

Once the dependencies have been installed, start the server via `npm start` (or `node index.js` if you prefer). 

Once started, it will open a browser window with the ‘Responsive Starter Kit Basic’ page loaded.
